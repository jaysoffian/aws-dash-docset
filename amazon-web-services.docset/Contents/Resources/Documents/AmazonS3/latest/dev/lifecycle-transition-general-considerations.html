                        you can transition the objects to the INTELLIGENT_TIERING storage class for
                        automatic cost savings. For information about storage classes, see <a href="storage-class-intro.html">Amazon S3 Storage Classes</a>.

                        For example, suppose that the objects you create have a well-defined lifecycle.
                        Initially, the objects are frequently accessed for a period of 30 days. Then,
                        objects are infrequently accessed for up to 90 days. After that, the objects are
                        no longer needed, so you might choose to archive or delete them.

                     <p>In this scenario, you can create a lifecycle rule in which you specify the

                        storage, another transition action to GLACIER storage for archiving, and an
                        expiration action. As you move the objects from one storage class to another,
                        you save on storage cost. For more information about cost considerations, see

                        <p>You can&apos;t specify a single lifecycle rule for both INTELLIGENT_TIERING (or
                           STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA) and GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE transitions when the
                           GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE transition occurs less than 30 days after the
                           INTELLIGENT_TIERING, STANDARD_IA, or ONEZONE_IA transition. That&apos;s because
                           there is a minimum 30-day storage charge associated with the
                           INTELLIGENT_TIERING, STANDARD_IA, and ONEZONE_IA storage classes. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The same 30-day minimum applies when you specify a transition from
                           STANDARD_IA storage to ONEZONE_IA or INTELLIGENT_TIERING storage. You can
                           specify two rules to accomplish this, but you pay minimum storage charges.

                     <p>If you are planning to archive infrequently accessed data for a period of
                        months or years, the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes can reduce
                        your storage costs. However, to ensure that the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE
                        storage class is appropriate for you, consider the following:

                     <p>Archived objects are not accessible in real time. You must first initiate
                        a restore request and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is
                        available for the duration that you specify in the request. After you
                        receive a temporary copy of the restored object, the object&apos;s storage class
                        remains GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE. (A <a href="./AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectHEAD.html">HEAD Object</a> or <a href="./AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html">GET Object</a> API operation
                        request will return GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE as the storage class.) 
                     </p>
                     
                     <div class="aws-note">
                        <p class="aws-note">Note</p>
                        <p>When you restore an archive, you are paying for both the archive
                           (GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE rate) and a copy that you restored temporarily
                           (REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage rate). For information about pricing, see
                           <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing</a>.

                     <p>You can restore an object copy programmatically or by using the Amazon S3
                        console. Amazon S3 processes only one restore request at a time per object. For
                        more information, see <a href="restoring-objects.html">Restoring Archived Objects</a>.
