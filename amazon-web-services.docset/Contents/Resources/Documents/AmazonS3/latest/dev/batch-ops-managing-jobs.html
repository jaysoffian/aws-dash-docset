                     <p>Amazon S3 provides a robust set of tools to help you manage your batch operations
                        jobs after you have
                        created them. This section describes the operations you can use to manage your jobs.
                        You can
                        perform all of the operations listed in this section using the AWS Management Console,
                        AWS CLI, AWS SDKs,
                        or REST APIs.

                     <p>You can retrieve a list of your batch operations jobs. The list includes jobs that
                        haven&apos;t yet finished and jobs that finished within the last 90 days. The job list
                        includes information for each job, such as its ID, description, priority, current
                        status, and the number of tasks that have succeeded and failed. You can filter your
                        job
                        list by status. When you retrieve a job list through the console, you can also search
                        your jobs by description or ID and filter them by AWS Region.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <h2 id="batch-ops-job-details">Viewing Job Details</h2>
                     
                     <p>If you want more information about a job than you can retrieve by listing jobs, you
                        can view all of the details for a single job. In addition to the information returned
                        in
                        a job list, a single job&apos;s details include other items. This information includes
                        the
                        operation parameters, details about the manifest, information about the completion
                        report (if you configured one when you created the job), and the Amazon Resource Name
                        (ARN) of the user role that you assigned to run the job. By viewing an individual
                        job&apos;s
                        details, you can access a job&apos;s entire configuration. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <h2 id="batch-ops-job-priority">Assigning Job Priority</h2>
                     
                     <p>You can assign each job a numeric priority, which can be any positive integer.
                        Amazon S3 batch operations prioritize jobs according to the assigned priority. Jobs
                        with
                        a higher priority (or a higher numeric value for the priority parameter) are evaluated
                        first. Priority is determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a
                        priority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority
                        value of 1. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can change a job&apos;s priority while it is running. If you submit a new job with
                        a
                        higher priority while a job is running, the lower-priority job can pause to allow
                        the
                        higher-priority job to run.
                     </p>
                     
                     <div class="aws-note">
                        <p class="aws-note">Note</p>
                        <p>Amazon S3 batch operations honor job priorities on a best-effort basis. Although
                           jobs with higher priorities generally take precedence over jobs with lower
                           priorities, Amazon S3 does not guarantee strict ordering of jobs.

                     <p>After you create a job, it progresses through a series of statuses. The following
                        table
                        describes the statuses that jobs can have and the possible transitions between job
                        statuses.

                     <p>If a batch operations job encounters a problem that prevents it from running
                        successfully, such as not being able to read the specified manifest, the job fails.
                        When
                        a job fails, it generates one or more failure codes or failure reasons. Amazon S3
                        batch operations
                        store the failure codes and reasons with the job so that you can view them by requesting
                        the job&apos;s details. If you requested a completion report for the job, the failure codes
                        and reasons also appear there.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>To prevent jobs from running a large number of unsuccessful operations, Amazon S3
                        imposes a
                        task-failure threshold on every batch operations job. When a job has executed at least
                        1,000
                        tasks, Amazon S3 monitors the task failure rate. If, at any point, the failure rate
                        (the
                        number of tasks that have failed as a proportion of the total number of tasks that
                        have
                        executed) exceeds 50 percent, then the job fails. If your job fails because it exceeded
                        the task-failure threshold, you can identify the cause of the failures. For example,
                        you
                        might have accidentally included some objects in the manifest that don&apos;t exist in
                        the
                        specified bucket. After fixing the errors, you can resubmit the job.
                     </p>
                     
                     <div class="aws-note">

                        <p>Amazon S3 batch operations operate asynchronously and the tasks don&apos;t necessarily
                           execute in
                           the order that the objects are listed in the manifest. Therefore, you can&apos;t use the
                           manifest ordering to determine which objects&apos; tasks succeeded and which ones failed.
                           Instead, you can examine the job&apos;s completion report (if you requested one) or view
                           your AWS CloudTrail event logs to help determine the source of the failures.

                     <p>In addition to requesting completion reports, you can also capture, review, and audit
                        batch operations activity using Amazon S3 events. As a job progresses, it emits events
                        that you can
                        capture using AWS CloudTrail, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and
                        Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Because batch
                        operations use existing Amazon S3 APIs to perform tasks, those tasks also emit the
                        same
                        events that they would if you called them directly. Thus, you can track and record
                        the
                        progress of your job and all of its tasks using the same notification, logging, and
                        auditing tools and processes that you already use with Amazon S3. For more information
                        about
                        Amazon S3 events, see <a href="NotificationHowTo.html"> Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a>.

                     <p>When you create a job, you can request a completion report. Then as long as
                        Amazon S3 batch operations successfully invoke at least one task, Amazon S3 generates
                        a
                        completion report after it finishes running tasks, fails, or is canceled. You can
                        configure the completion report to include all tasks or only failed tasks. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The completion report includes the job configuration and status and information for
                        each task, including the object key and version, status, error codes, and descriptions
                        of any errors. If you don&apos;t configure a completion report, you can still monitor and
                        audit your job and its tasks using CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon SNS, and
                        Amazon SQS. However, completion
                        reports provide an easy way to view the results of your tasks in a consolidated format
                        with no additional setup required. For an example of a completion report, see
