                     <p>Many applications that store data in Amazon S3 serve a &#x201C;working set&#x201D; of data that
                        is
                        repeatedly requested by users. If a workload is sending repeated GET requests for
                        a common
                        set of objects, you can use a cache such as <a href="./cloudfront/index.html">Amazon CloudFront</a>, <a href="./elasticache/index.html">Amazon ElastiCache</a>, or <a href="./mediastore/index.html">AWS Elemental MediaStore</a> to optimize performance.
                        Successful cache adoption can result in low latency and high data transfer rates.
                        Applications that use caching also send fewer direct requests to Amazon S3, which
                        can help reduce
                        request costs.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) that transparently caches
                        data from
                        Amazon S3 in a large set of geographically distributed points of presence (PoPs).
                        When objects
                        might be accessed from multiple Regions, or over the internet, CloudFront allows data
                        to be cached
                        close to the users that are accessing the objects. This can result in high performance
                        delivery of popular Amazon S3 content. For information about CloudFront, see the <a href="./AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/">Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</a>.

                     <p>Amazon ElastiCache is a managed, in-memory cache. With ElastiCache, you can provision
                        Amazon EC2 instances
                        that cache objects in memory. This caching results in orders of magnitude reduction
                        in GET
                        latency and substantial increases in download throughput. To use ElastiCache, you
                        modify
                        application logic to both populate the cache with hot objects and check the cache
                        for hot
                        objects before requesting them from Amazon S3. For examples of using ElastiCache to
                        improve Amazon S3 GET
                        performance, see the blog post <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/turbocharge-amazon-s3-with-amazon-elasticache-for-redis/" target="_blank">Turbocharge Amazon S3 with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a>.

                     <p>There are certain situations where an application receives a response from Amazon
                        S3
                        indicating that a retry is necessary. Amazon S3 maps bucket and object names to the
                        object data
                        associated with them. If an application generates high request rates (typically sustained
                        rates of over 5,000 requests per second to a small number of objects), it might receive
                        HTTP
                        503 <em>slowdown</em> responses. If these errors occur, each AWS
                        SDK implements automatic retry logic using exponential backoff. If you are not using
                        an AWS
                        SDK, you should implement retry logic when receiving the HTTP 503 error. For information
                        about back-off techniques, see <a href="./general/latest/gr/api-retries.html">Error Retries and
                           Exponential Backoff in AWS</a> in the <em>Amazon Web Services General Reference</em>.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Amazon S3 automatically scales in response to sustained new request rates, dynamically
                        optimizing performance. While Amazon S3 is internally optimizing for a new request
                        rate, you
                        will receive HTTP 503 request responses temporarily until the optimization completes.
                        After
                        Amazon S3 internally optimizes performance for the new request rate, all requests
                        are generally
                        served without retries. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For latency-sensitive applications, Amazon S3 advises tracking and aggressively retrying
                        slower operations. When you retry a request, we recommend using a new connection to
                        Amazon S3 and
                        performing a fresh DNS lookup. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When you make large variably sized requests (for example, more than 128 MB), we advise
                        tracking the throughput being achieved and retrying the slowest 5 percent of the requests.
                        When you make smaller requests (for example, less than 512 KB), where median latencies
                        are
                        often in the tens of milliseconds range, a good guideline is to retry a GET or PUT
                        operation
                        after 2 seconds. If additional retries are needed, the best practice is to back off.
                        For
                        example, we recommend issuing one retry after 2 seconds and a second retry after an
                        additional 4 seconds.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If your application makes fixed-size requests to Amazon S3, you should expect more
                        consistent
                        response times for each of these requests. In this case, a simple strategy is to identify
                        the slowest 1 percent of requests and to retry them. Even a single retry is frequently
                        effective at reducing latency.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you are using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for server-side encryption,

                        Parallelization for High Throughput
                     </h2>
                     
                     <p>Amazon S3 is a very large distributed system. To help you take advantage of its scale,
                        we
                        encourage you to horizontally scale parallel requests to the Amazon S3 service endpoints.
                        In
                        addition to distributing the requests within Amazon S3, this type of scaling approach
                        helps
                        distribute the load over multiple paths through the network.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For high-throughput transfers, Amazon S3 advises using applications that use multiple
                        connections to GET or PUT data in parallel. For example, this is supported by <a href="./sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/examples-s3-transfermanager.html">Amazon S3 Transfer Manager</a> in the
                        AWS Java SDK, and most of the other AWS SDKs provide similar constructs. For some
                        applications, you can achieve parallel connections by launching multiple requests
                        concurrently in different application threads, or in different application instances.
                        The
                        best approach to take depends on your application and the structure of the objects
                        that you
                        are accessing.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can use the AWS SDKs to issue GET and PUT requests directly rather than employing
                        the management of transfers in the AWS SDK. This approach lets you tune your workload
                        more
                        directly, while still benefiting from the SDK&#x2019;s support for retries and its handling
                        of any
                        HTTP 503 responses that might occur. As a general rule, when you download large objects
                        within a Region from Amazon S3 to <a href="./ec2/index.html">Amazon EC2</a>, 
                        we suggest making concurrent requests for byte ranges of
                        an object at the granularity of 8&#x2013;16 MB. Make one concurrent request for each
                        85&#x2013;90 MB/s of desired network throughput. To saturate a 10 Gb/s network interface
                        card (NIC), you might use about 15 concurrent requests over separate connections.
                        You can
                        scale up the concurrent requests over more connections to saturate faster NICs, such
                        as 25
                        Gb/s or 100 Gb/s NICs. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Measuring performance is important when you tune the number of requests to issue
                        concurrently. We recommend starting with a single request at a time. Measure the network
                        bandwidth being achieved and the use of other resources that your application uses
                        in
                        processing the data. You can then identify the bottleneck resource (that is, the resource
                        with the highest usage), and hence the number of requests that are likely to be useful.
                        For
                        example, if processing one request at a time leads to a CPU usage of 25 percent, it
                        suggests
                        that up to four concurrent requests can be accommodated. Measurement is essential,
                        and it is
                        worth confirming resource use as the request rate is increased. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If your application issues requests directly to Amazon S3 using the REST API, we recommend
                        using a pool of HTTP connections and re-using each connection for a series of requests.
                        Avoiding per-request connection setup removes the need to perform TCP slow-start and
                        Secure
                        Sockets Layer (SSL) handshakes on each request. For information about using the REST
                        API,
                        see the <a href="./AmazonS3/latest/API/">Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference</a>.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Finally, it&#x2019;s worth paying attention to DNS and double-checking that requests are
                        being
                        spread over a wide pool of Amazon S3 IP addresses. DNS queries for Amazon S3 cycle
                        through a large
                        list of IP endpoints. But caching resolvers or application code that reuses a single
                        IP
                        address do not benefit from address diversity and the load balancing that follows
                        from it.
                        Network utility tools such as the <code class="code">netstat</code> command line tool can show the IP
                        addresses being used for communication with Amazon S3, and we provide guidelines for
                        DNS
                        configurations to use. For more information about these guidelines, see <a href="DNSConsiderations.html">DNS Considerations</a>.

                     <h2 id="optimizing-performance-acceleration">Using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to
                        Accelerate Geographically Disparate Data Transfers
                     </h2>
                     
                     <p><a href="transfer-acceleration.html">Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration</a> is
                        effective at minimizing or eliminating the latency caused by geographic distance between
                        globally dispersed clients and a regional application using Amazon S3. Transfer Acceleration
                        uses
                        the globally distributed edge locations in CloudFront for data transport. The AWS
                        edge network has
                        points of presence in more than 50 locations. Today, it is used to distribute content
                        through CloudFront and to provide rapid responses to DNS queries made to <a href="./route53/index.html">Amazon Route&#xA0;53</a>. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The edge network also helps to accelerate data transfers into and out of Amazon S3.
                        It is
                        ideal for applications that transfer data across or between continents, have a fast
                        internet
                        connection, use large objects, or have a lot of content to upload. As the data arrives
                        at an
                        edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path. In general,
                        the
                        farther away you are from an Amazon S3 Region, the higher the speed improvement you
                        can expect
                        from using Transfer Acceleration. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can set up Transfer Acceleration on new or existing buckets. You can use a separate
                        Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration endpoint to use the AWS edge locations. The best way
                        to test
                        whether Transfer Acceleration helps client request performance is to use the <a href="http://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration Speed Comparison tool</a>. Network configurations and conditions
                        vary from time to time and from location to location. So you are charged only for
                        transfers
                        where Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can potentially improve your upload performance.
                        For
                        information about using Transfer Acceleration with different AWS SDKs, see <a href="transfer-acceleration-examples.html">Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration Examples</a>.
