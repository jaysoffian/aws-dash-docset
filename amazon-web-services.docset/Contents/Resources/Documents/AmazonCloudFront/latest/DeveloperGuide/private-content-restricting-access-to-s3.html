                     </h1>
                     <p>To restrict access to content that you serve from Amazon S3 buckets, you create CloudFront
                        signed URLs or signed cookies to 
                        			limit access to files in your Amazon S3 bucket, and then you create a special CloudFront
                        user called an origin access identity 
                        			(OAI) and associate it with your distribution. Then you configure permissions so
                        that CloudFront can use the OAI to 
                        			access and serve files to your users, but users can&apos;t use a direct URL to the S3
                        bucket to access a file there.
                        			Taking these steps help you maintain secure access to the files that you serve
                        through CloudFront.
                     </p>
                     <p>In general, if you&apos;re using an Amazon S3 bucket as the origin for a CloudFront distribution,
                        you can either allow everyone to have access
                        			to the files there, or you can restrict access. If you limit access by using, for
                        example, CloudFront signed URLs or signed
                        			cookies, you also won&apos;t want people to be able to view files by simply using the
                        direct URL for the file. Instead, you
                        			want them to only access the files by using the CloudFront URL, so your protections
                        work. For more information about
                        			using signed URLs and signed cookies, see <a href="PrivateContent.html">Serving Private Content with Signed URLs and Signed Cookies</a></p>
                     <p>This topic explains in detail how to set up the OAI and grant permissions to maintain
                        secure access to
                        			your S3 files.

                        <p>If you use an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website endpoint, you must set it up

                           				you can&apos;t use the origin access identity feature described in this topic. However,

                           				access to content on a custom origin by setting up custom headers and configuring

                     <p>When you first set up an Amazon S3 bucket as the origin for a CloudFront distribution,
                        you grant everyone permission to read
                        			the files in your bucket. This allows anyone to access your files either through
                        CloudFront or using the Amazon S3 URL. CloudFront
                        			doesn&apos;t expose Amazon S3 URLs, but your users might have those URLs if your application
                        serves any files directly from Amazon S3
                        			or if anyone gives out direct links to specific files in Amazon S3.
                     </p>
                     
                     		
                     <p>If you use CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies to limit access to files in your
                        Amazon S3 bucket, you probably also want
                        			to prevent users from accessing your Amazon S3 files by using Amazon S3 URLs. If
                        users access your files directly in Amazon S3, they
                        			bypass the controls provided by CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies, for example,
                        control over the date and time that a
                        			user can no longer access your content and control over which IP addresses can
                        be used to access content. In addition,
                        			if users access files both through CloudFront and directly by using Amazon S3 URLs,
                        CloudFront access logs are less useful because
                        			they&apos;re incomplete.
                     </p>
                     
                     		
                     <p>To ensure that your users access your files using only CloudFront URLs, regardless
                        of whether the URLs are signed, do the
                        			following:
                     </p>

                           <p>Create an origin access identity, which is a special CloudFront user, and associate
                              the origin access identity
                              					with your distribution. You associate the origin access identity with origins,
                              so that you can secure all or
                              					just some of your Amazon S3 content. You can also create an origin access identity
                              and add it to your distribution
                              					when you create the distribution. For more information, see <a href="private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html#private-content-creating-oai">Creating a CloudFront Origin Access Identity and Adding it to Your

                              so that only the origin
                              					access identity has read permission (or read and download permission). When your
                              users access your Amazon S3 files
                              					through CloudFront, the CloudFront origin access identity gets the files on behalf
                              of your users. If your users request
                              					files directly by using Amazon S3 URLs, they&apos;re denied access. The origin access
                              identity has permission to access
                              					files in your Amazon S3 bucket, but users don&apos;t. For more information, see <a href="private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html#private-content-granting-permissions-to-oai">Granting the Origin Access Identity Permission to
