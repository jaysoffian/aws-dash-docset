                     <p>In this example, you see the CPU utilization of a <code class="code">t3.nano</code> instance
                        launched as <code class="code">unlimited</code>, and how it spends <em>earned</em> and <em>surplus</em> credits to
                        sustain CPU performance.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A <code class="code">t3.nano</code> instance earns 144 CPU credits over a rolling 24-hour
                        period, which it can redeem for 144 minutes of vCPU use. When it depletes its CPU
                        credit balance (represented by the CloudWatch metric <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code>), it can
                        spend <em>surplus</em> CPU credits&#x2014;that it has
                        <em>not yet earned</em>&#x2014;to burst for as long as
                        it needs. Because a <code class="code">t3.nano</code> instance earns a maximum of 144 credits in a
                        24-hour period, it can spend surplus credits up to that maximum without being charged
                        immediately. If it spends more than 144 CPU credits, it is charged for the difference
                        at the end of the hour.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>The intent of the example, illustrated by the following graph, is to show how
                        an instance can burst using surplus credits even after it depletes its

                        0%&#x2014;and no credits are spent. All unspent credits are accrued in the credit balance.
                        For the first 24 hours, <code class="code">CPUCreditUsage</code> is at 0, and the

                        credits. In the same time, the instance earns 72 credits. The instance earns more
                        credits than it spends, and the <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code> value increases to 122
                        credits.

                        bursts at 100% CPU utilization, and spends a total of 570 credits to sustain the
                        burst. About an hour into this period, the instance depletes its entire
                        <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code> of 122 credits, and starts to spend surplus credits
                        to sustain the high CPU performance, totaling 448 surplus credits in this period
                        (570-122=448). When the <code class="code">CPUSurplusCreditBalance</code> value reaches 144 CPU
                        credits (the maximum a <code class="code">t3.nano</code> instance can earn in a 24-hour period),
                        any surplus credits spent thereafter cannot be offset by earned credits. The surplus
                        credits spent thereafter amounts to 304 credits (448-144=304), which results in a
                        small additional charge at the end of the hour for 304 credits.

                     <p>A <code class="code">t2.nano</code> instance earns 72 CPU credits over a rolling 24-hour period,

                        balance (represented by the CloudWatch metric <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code>), it can spend
