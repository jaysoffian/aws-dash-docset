                     <p>With EC2-Classic, your instances run in a single, flat network that you share
                        with other customers. With Amazon VPC, your instances run in a virtual private cloud
                        (VPC)
                        that&apos;s logically isolated to your AWS account.
                     </p>
                     <p>The EC2-Classic platform was introduced in the original release of Amazon EC2. If
                        you created
                        your AWS account after 2013-12-04, it does not support EC2-Classic, so you must launch
                        your
                        Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC.
                     </p>
                     <p>If your account does not support EC2-Classic, we create a default VPC for you. 
                        By default, when you launch an instance, we launch it into your default VPC.  
                        Alternatively, you can create a nondefault VPC and specify it when you launch an 
                        instance.
                     </p>

                     <p>The Amazon EC2 console indicates which platforms you can launch instances into for
                        the
                        selected region, and whether you have a default VPC in that region.

                     <p>Verify that the region you&apos;ll use is selected in the navigation bar. 
                        On the Amazon EC2 console dashboard, look for <b>Supported Platforms</b> 
                        under <b>Account Attributes</b>.

                     <p>You can migrate as many EC2-Classic Elastic IP addresses as you can have in your account.
                        However, when you migrate an Elastic IP address, it counts against your
                        Elastic IP address limit for VPCs. You cannot migrate an Elastic IP address if
                        it will result in your exceeding your limit. Similarly, when you restore an Elastic
                        IP address to EC2-Classic, it counts against your Elastic IP address limit for
                        EC2-Classic. For more information, see <a href="elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#using-instance-addressing-limit">Elastic IP Address Limit</a>.

                        less
