                     <p>Reserved Instances provide you with a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance
                        		pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount
                        		applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. These On-Demand Instances
                        must
                        		match certain attributes in order to benefit from the billing discount.
                     </p>
                     <p>The following diagram shows a basic overview of purchasing and using Reserved Instances.</p>

                     <p>In this scenario, you have a running On-Demand Instance (T2) in your account, for
                        which
                        		you&apos;re currently paying On-Demand rates. You purchase a Reserved Instance that matches
                        the
                        		attributes of your running instance, and the billing benefit is immediately applied.
                        Next,
                        		you purchase a Reserved Instance for a C4 instance. You do not have any running
                        instances in
                        		your account that match the attributes of this Reserved Instance. In the final step,
                        you
                        		launch an instance that matches the attributes of the C4 Reserved Instance, and
                        the billing
                        		benefit is immediately applied.

                     <p>There is a limit to the number of Reserved Instances that you can purchase per month.
                        For each Region you
                        			can purchase 20 <a href="apply_ri.html#apply-regional-ri">regional</a> Reserved Instances per month plus
                        			an additional 20 <a href="apply_ri.html#apply-zonal-ri">zonal</a> Reserved Instances per month for each
                        			Availability Zone.

                     <p>For example, in a Region with three Availability Zones, the limit is 80 Reserved Instances
                        per month: 20
                        			regional Reserved Instances for the Region plus 20 zonal Reserved Instances for
                        each of the three Availability

                     <p>A regional Reserved Instance applies a discount to a running On-Demand Instance. The
                        default On-Demand Instance limit is 20. You
                        			cannot exceed your running On-Demand Instance limit by purchasing regional Reserved
                        Instances. For example, if you
                        			already have 20 running On-Demand Instances, and you purchase 20 regional Reserved
                        Instances, the 20 regional
                        			Reserved Instances are used to apply a discount to the 20 running On-Demand Instances.
                        If you purchase more
                        			regional Reserved Instances, you will not be able to launch more instances because
                        you have reached
                        			your On-Demand Instance limit.
