                        applications on it. Whether an instance is used or remains idle determines if credits
                        are spent or accrued. If an instance remains idle for 24 hours from the time it is
                        launched, the credit balance reaches it limit, which is the maximum number of earned

                        showing the rate at which credits are earned, accrued, spent, and discarded, and the

                     <p>In this example, you see how a <code class="code">t2.nano</code> instance launched as
                        <code class="code">standard</code> earns, accrues, and spends <em>launch</em> and <em>earned</em> credits. You see how
                        the credit balance reflects not only accrued <em>earned</em>
                        credits, but also accrued <em>launch</em> credits.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A <code class="code">t2.nano</code> instance gets 30 launch credits when it is launched, and earns
                        72 credits every 24 hours. Its credit balance limit is 72 earned credits; launch
                        credits do not count towards the limit. After the limit is reached, new credits that
                        are earned are discarded. For more information about the number of credits that can
                        be earned and accrued, see the <a href="burstable-credits-baseline-concepts.html#burstable-performance-instances-credit-table">credit table</a>. 
                        For more information about limits, see <a href="burstable-performance-instances-standard-mode.html#launch-credit-limits">Launch Credit Limits</a>.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You might launch a T2 Standard instance and use it immediately. Or, you might launch
                        a T2 Standard instance and leave it idle for a few days before running applications
                        on it. Whether an instance is used or remains idle determines if credits are spent
                        or
                        accrued. If an instance remains idle for 24 hours from the time it is launched, the
                        credit balance appears to exceed its limit because the balance reflects both accrued
                        earned credits and accrued launch credits. However, after CPU is used, the launch
                        credits are spent first. Thereafter, the limit always reflects the maximum number
                        of
                        earned credits that can be accrued.

                        is
                        launched, and walks you through seven periods of time over a 96-hour period, showing
                        the
                        rate at which credits are earned, accrued, spent, and discarded, and the value of

                        credit balance at the end of each period.

                        immediately gets 30 launch credits. It earns credits while in the running state. The

                        0%&#x2014;and no credits are spent. All unspent credits are accrued in the credit
                        balance. At approximately 14 hours after launch, the credit balance is 72 (30 launch
                        credits + 42 earned credits), which is equivalent to what the instance can earn in
                        24
                        hours. At 24 hours after launch, the credit balance exceeds 72 credits because the
                        unspent launch credits are accrued in the credit balance&#x2014;the credit balance is
                        102 credits: 30 launch credits + 72 earned credits.

                        than what it can earn in 24 hours (30 launch credits + 72 earned credits = 102
                        credits).

                        launching and running, which prevents the balance from reaching the maximum

                     <p>An instance constantly earns credits, but cannot accrue more earned credits if
                        the credit balance limit has been reached. After the limit is reached, newly
                        earned credits are discarded. The credit balance limit is determined by the
                        number of credits that an instance can earn in 24 hours. For more information
                        about credit balance limits, see the <a href="burstable-credits-baseline-concepts.html#burstable-performance-instances-credit-table">credit table</a>.
