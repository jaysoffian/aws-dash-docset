                     <p>As your needs change, you might find that your instance is over-utilized (the instance
                        type
                        is too small) or under-utilized (the instance type is too large). If this is the case,
                        you can
                        change the size of your instance. For example, if your <code class="code">t2.micro</code> instance is too
                        small for its workload, you can change it to another instance type that is appropriate
                        for the
                        workload.
                     </p>
                     <p>You might also want to migrate from a previous generation instance type to a current
                        generation instance type to take advantage of some features; for example, support
                        for IPv6.
                     </p>
                     <p>If the root device for your instance is an EBS volume, you can change the size of
                        the
                        instance simply by changing its instance type, which is known as <em>resizing</em>
                        it. If the root device for your instance is an instance store volume, you must migrate
                        your
                        application to a new instance with the instance type that you need. For more information
                        about
                        root device volumes, see <a href="ComponentsAMIs.html#storage-for-the-root-device">Storage for the Root Device</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>When you resize an instance, you must select an instance type that is compatible with
                        the
                        configuration of the instance. If the instance type that you want is not compatible
                        with the
                        instance configuration you have, then you must migrate your application to a new instance
                        with
                        the instance type that you need.

                        <p>When you resize an instance, the resized instance usually has the same number of instance
                           store volumes that you specified when you launched the original instance. With instance
                           types 
                           that support NVMe instance store volumes (which are available by default), the resized
                           instance
                           might have additional instance store volumes, depending on the AMI. Otherwise, you
                           can migrate 
                           your application to an instance with a new instance type manually, specifying the
                           number of 
                           instance store volumes that you need when you launch the new instance.
